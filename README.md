# **Virtual Help Lab**
This Web Program will serve as an opportunity for students to identify other students who are at similar parts of an assignment, allowing them to interact with one another and work through the assignment together. This will also allow TAs to identify where students are struggling and adjust their efforts accordingly.
## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
Many students struggle with the various assignments and as an educator, it can be difficult to ensure that every student gets the opportunity to meet with an instructor or TA to receive the help that they need. Collaborating with other students is a commonly overlooked resource that can be a powerful tool in college and the workforce. My site connects students to their peers at similar points of any assignment, encouraging engagement between students and allowing them to take the role of teacher as they work to complete a given assignment. Additionally, it allows TAs to monitor students' progress and offer help where it's most needed. Guided learing has never been easier than it is now.
